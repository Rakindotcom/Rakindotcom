# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate **UI/UX Designer** currently diving into the world of **Full Stack Development**. My journey in design has been all about creating user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing experiences, and now I'm expanding my skill set to build and bring these ideas to life from the ground up!

### ðŸ›  Skills & Tools
- **Design:** Figma, Adobe XD
- **Development:** HTML, CSS, C, C++
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Editor:** VS Code

### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
I'm on a mission to level up in web development, exploring both frontend and backend technologies to become a versatile developer. I'm putting my heart and soul into every step, even if my short attention span sometimes makes it a fun challenge! ðŸ˜…

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- **Build a Portfolio:** Showcasing both my design work and my journey into full stack development.
- **Contribute to Open Source:** Collaborate with others, learn from their code, and give back to the community.

### âš¡ Fun Fact
I have a very short attention span, so I'm always looking for new, engaging ways to learn and stay focused. ðŸš€

I'm excited to connect with other developers and designers! Feel free to check out my work, suggest improvements, or just say hello. Let's create something awesome together!
